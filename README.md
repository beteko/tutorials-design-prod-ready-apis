## :mag: Overview 

<br>

This tutorial will guide you through a clear roadmap to design a ready-to-use Python API that meets the basic industry standards. Although brief, it includes exercises, reflection points, and suggestions for improving upon the essentials.

 - By the end of this tutorial, one should  be able to  
    - Plan for an API Design before its implementation (Specs first) 
    - Secure an API
    - Enable logging for traceability
    - Ensure Quality of code
    - Understand the Continuous Integration and Deployment Process ( Github Action )

## :memo: Case Study

<br>

<img style="float: center" src="docs/images/wine-tasting.jpg">

Since an API seeks to provide useful services to its end users, it is imperative to start with a working program/code in an experimental context. For our part, we decided to design the **Wine Quality Predictor** API ( :wine_glass: ) whose functional   prototype can be viewed [here](https://github.com/architjen/Orness_DS_training).

## :checkered_flag: Pre-Requisites 

<br>

- A basic understanding of **Python 3** is required to follow this tutorial
- A good IDE  ( Pycharm / Visual Code/ IntelliJ  ... )
- A GitHub Account 
- And that's it ! Really :innocent:
