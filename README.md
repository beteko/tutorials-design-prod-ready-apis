## Overview 

This tutorial will guide you through a clear roadmap to design a ready-to-use Python API that meets the basic industry standards. Although brief, it includes exercises, reflexion points, and suggestions for improving upon the essentials.

 - By the end of this tutorial, one should  be able to  
    - Plan for an API Design before its implementation (Specs first) 
    - Secure an API
    - Enable logging for tranceability
    - Ensure Quality of code
    - Understand the Continuous Integration and Deployment Process ( Github Action )
  


## Case study

As an API seeks to provide useful services to its end-users, it is imperative to start with a functional program/code from an experimental context. For our part, we decided to design the **Wine Quality Predictor** API whose functional prototype can be viewed her [here](https://github.com/architjen/MLOps_wine_quality). 
  



## Pre-requisites 

A basic understanding of **Python 3** is required to follow this tutorial. And that's it! Really :)
